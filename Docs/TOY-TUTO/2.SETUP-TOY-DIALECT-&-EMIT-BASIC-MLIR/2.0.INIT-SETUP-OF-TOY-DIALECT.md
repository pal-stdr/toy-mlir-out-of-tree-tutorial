# Initializing the Setup of TOY `Dialect`

- For what & why of `MLIR` + `Dialect` - [Docs/MLIR-KNOWLEDGE-BASE/1.WHAT-&-WHY-OF-MLIR-&-DIALECT.md](Docs/MLIR-KNOWLEDGE-BASE/1.WHAT-&-WHY-OF-MLIR-&-DIALECT.md)


- **I WILL STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO READ [Chapter 2: Emitting Basic MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tutorials/Toy/Ch-2/) FROM BEGINNING UNTIL THE END OF THE [Using the Operation Definition Specification (ODS) Framework](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tutorials/Toy/Ch-2/#using-the-operation-definition-specification-ods-framework) SECTION THOROUGHLY. THEN START FOLLOWING THE REST OF THIS DOC.**


# Why do we need to define `Dialect`?

Until now, we have done upto the `AST` generation for our Toy language. <ins>**To interface that toy `AST` with `MLIR`, we have to define a new Toy `Dialect`.** This dialect will model the structure of the Toy language, as well as provide an easy avenue for high-level analysis and transformation.

# Resources

Codes are collected from `llvm-18-src-build/mlir/examples/toy/Ch2`


# 1. Create the Header + Dialect file and populate them w/ code

## 1.1. Create `Dialect/` dir at `tools/toy-compiler/include/`

This is where the `Dialect.h` and `Ops.td` will be created and populated. 

```sh
mkdir -p tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/
```

## 1.2. Now create `Ops.td` & `Dialect.h` at `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/`

```sh
touch tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Ops.td tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Dialect.h
```

## 1.3. The concepts behind the dialect code that will go inside `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Ops.td` [ONLY CONCEPT]

`Ops.td` is the file where you will define the Dialect.

### 1.3.1. Dialects
- **Dialects are the `containers` of `rules` & `specifications` while you are modeling the structure of a language AST to `IR`. This is what we will do in this chapter.**

- Dialect can be also written for `IR` to `IR`. This is called IR translation or IR lowering. IR translation is the process of converting IR from one dialect to another.

### 1.3.2 Typical specifications of a Dialect
- `name` of the Dialect.
- `Description` of the Dialect.
- `type` of input arguments.
- `type` of output/`return`.
- Defining `Ops` (For this, we will use `ODS` framework)
- etc.

Example:

```js
// Provide a definition of the 'toy' dialect in the ODS framework so that we
// can define our operations.
def Toy_Dialect : Dialect {
  // The namespace of our dialect, this corresponds 1-1 with the string we
  // provided in `ToyDialect::getDialectNamespace`.
  let name = "toy";

  // A short one-line summary of our dialect.
  let summary = "A high-level dialect for analyzing and optimizing the "
                "Toy language";

  // A much longer description of our dialect.
  let description = [{
    The Toy language is a tensor-based language that allows you to define
    functions, perform some math computation, and print results. This dialect
    provides a representation of the language that is amenable to analysis and
    optimization.
  }];

  // The C++ namespace that the dialect class definition resides in.
  let cppNamespace = "toy";
}
```

### 1.3.3 Inside a Dialect, we have MLIR Operations a.k.a. `Ops`

- MLIR is designed to allow all IR elements, such as attributes, operations, and types, to be customized for a Dialect.

- `Ops` are the building block of a Dialect.
```mlir
%4 = "toy.constant"() {value = dense<1.0> : tensor<2x3xf64>} : () -> tensor<2x3xf64>
```

### 1.3.4 Language or Frameworks for defining Dialect

**<ins>1.3.4.1. Language or Frameworks for just Dialect container</ins>:**
Dialects can be defined using `C++`. But MLIR also supports defining dialects declaratively via [LLVM TableGen](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.html). Using the declarative specification is much cleaner as it removes the need for a large portion of the boilerplate when defining a new dialect. It also enables easy generation of dialect documentation, which can be described directly alongside the dialect.

**<ins>1.3.4.2. Language or Frameworks for just `Ops`</ins>:**

It's pretty confusing I know ðŸ˜²! Fear not! It's simple.ðŸ™‚

- `Ops` can also be defined by `C++` or [TableGen](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.html). **But here the MLIR org suggests to use a framework called [Operation Definition Specification (ODS)](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/DefiningDialects/Operations/). So that means, `Ops` can be defined by `ODS` framework inside the `TableGen`.** 

- **Why ODS? ðŸ¤”**

Let's read what the official doc says

> Facts regarding an operation are specified concisely into a TableGen record, which will be expanded into an equivalent `mlir::Op` C++ template specialization at compile time. **Using the ODS framework is the desired way for defining operations in MLIR given the simplicity, conciseness, and general stability in the face of C++ API changes**.

So the last sentence is very important ðŸ¤”. Specailly the part, where it says - **general stability in the face of C++ API changes**.


`ODS` and `TableGen` are both tools used to define MLIR dialects. However, they have different strengths and weaknesses.

ODS is a more modern and flexible approach to defining MLIR dialects. It is based on a type system that is more expressive than the `type` system used by `TableGen`. This allows `ODS` to define more complex and powerful dialects. `ODS` is also more modular than `TableGen`, which means that it is easier to break down complex dialects into smaller, more manageable pieces.

`TableGen` is a legacy tool that is still widely used to define MLIR dialects. **It is a simpler and more streamlined approach than `ODS`. This makes it easier to learn and use, and it is also more efficient for defining simple dialects. However, `TableGen` is not as expressive or flexible as `ODS`, and it is more difficult to break down complex dialects into smaller pieces.**

**So which one to use?**
- `ODS` is a better choice for defining complex MLIR dialects that need to be highly expressive and modular.

- `TableGen` is a better choice for defining simple MLIR dialects that need to be easy to learn and use.



**<ins>1.3.4.3. How to define the `Base Class` in `ODS`</ins>:**

Example:

```c++
// Base class for toy dialect operations. This operation inherits from the base
// `Op` class in OpBase.td, and provides:
//   * The parent dialect of the operation.
//   * The mnemonic for the operation, or the name without the dialect prefix.
//   * A list of traits for the operation.
class Toy_Op<string mnemonic, list<Trait> traits = []> :
    Op<Toy_Dialect, mnemonic, traits>;
```



## 1.4. (IMPLEMENTATION BEGINS AGAIN ðŸ˜‡) Populate `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Ops.td`

Insert following code. `Operations` are left empty for this tuto chapter. In the next one, we will little by little populate them.

```js

include "mlir/IR/SymbolInterfaces.td"
include "mlir/Interfaces/SideEffectInterfaces.td"



// Provide a definition of the 'toy' dialect in the ODS framework so that we
// can define our operations.
def Toy_Dialect : Dialect {
    let name = "toy";
    let cppNamespace = "::mlir::toy";
}




// Base class for toy dialect operations. This operation inherits from the base
// `Op` class in OpBase.td, and provides:
//   * The parent dialect of the operation.
//   * The mnemonic for the operation, or the name without the dialect prefix.
//   * A list of traits for the operation.
class Toy_Op<string mnemonic, list<Trait> traits = []> :
    Op<Toy_Dialect, mnemonic, traits>;



// We will define rest of the toy operations (i.e. 1.ConstantOp, 2.AddOp, 3.FuncOp,
// 4.GenericCallOp, 5.MulOp, 6.PrintOp, 7.ReshapeOp, 8.ReturnOp, 9.TransposeOp) by inheriting
// from our base 'Toy_Op' class above.
// Here we provide the mnemonic and a list of traits for the operation. The
// constant operation is marked as 'Pure' as it is a pure operation
// and may be removed if dead.

// Toy Operations
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//



//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
// 1. ConstantOp
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

#endif // TOY_OPS
```

## 1.5. Populate `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Dialect.h`

### 1.5.1. Before inserting the code in `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Dialect.h`, let's examine the code

```c++
//===- Dialect.h - Dialect definition for the Toy IR ----------------------===//

// This file implements the IR Dialect for the Toy language.
// See docs/Tutorials/Toy/Ch-2.md for more information.
//
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

#ifndef MLIR_TUTORIAL_TOY_DIALECT_H_
#define MLIR_TUTORIAL_TOY_DIALECT_H_

#include "mlir/Bytecode/BytecodeOpInterface.h"
#include "mlir/IR/Dialect.h"
#include "mlir/IR/SymbolTable.h"
#include "mlir/Interfaces/CallInterfaces.h"
#include "mlir/Interfaces/FunctionInterfaces.h"
#include "mlir/Interfaces/SideEffectInterfaces.h"

/// Include the auto-generated header file containing the declaration of the toy

/// Include the auto-generated header file containing the declarations of the
/// toy operations.
#define GET_OP_CLASSES
#include "Dialect/Ops.h.inc"

#endif // MLIR_TUTORIAL_TOY_DIALECT_H_
```

**Are you seeing last 2 `#include` headers `Dialect/Dialect.h.inc` & `Dialect/Ops.h.inc`?**

- Those header's are auto generated everytime we build `toy-compiler`. They are `C++` version of Dialect, that we have defined in `Dialect/Ops.td` TableGen. This concept is execptionally handy, because the `clang++` compiler we currently using to build the `toy-compiler`, cannot compile `Ops.td`. That's why, everytime we launch the build command through `build-mlir-18.sh`, those header's are autogenerated **on-the-fly** by CMake `commands()` (e.g. `mlir_tablegen()`).

- So now the question comes, if `clang` can't compile those, then who is generating the `.h.inc` header in the first place ðŸ¤”? **Answer is: `mlir-tblgen`. ðŸ˜‰** Want to check ðŸ˜ƒ? If you already build the `llvm-18-src-build` and added to your `OS` env `$PATH` the way I shown in the [How to Build LLVM 18 from source](../0.LLVM+MLIR-initial-setup-docs/0.0.SETUP-LLVM/0.0.1.SETUP-LLVM-for-NEWBIES.md), then `mlir-tblgen` in your OS global env. Even if not, no worries! You can still use the absolute path to the `mlir-tblgen` build.



### 1.5.2. Insert the code given in section `1.5.1.` in `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Dialect.h`

Insert the code and check the output with the following shell commands

```sh
# If you want to use "installation" dir
# echo $LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT => /path/to/llvm-18-src-build
$LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT/installation/bin/mlir-tblgen tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Ops.td -I $LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT/mlir/include/

# Or this one
$LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT/build/bin/mlir-tblgen tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/Ops.td -I $LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT/mlir/include/
```


# 2. Create Dialect definition file (`Dialect.cpp`) and populate them w/ code

## 2.1. Create dir `Dialect` at `tools/toy-compiler/lib/`

```sh
mkdir -p tools/toy-compiler/lib/Dialect/
```

## 2.2. Create `Dialect.cpp` at `tools/toy-compiler/lib/Dialect`

```sh
touch tools/toy-compiler/lib/Dialect/Dialect.cpp
```

## 2.3. Populate `tools/toy-compiler/lib/Dialect/Dialect.cpp` with `ToyDialect` init code

```c++

# 3. Now it's time to do the `CMake` config

I will Highly recommend to read the section **2.1. add_subdirectory():** [Here](../../MISCELLANEOUS/CMAKE-HOW-TO/CMAKE-KNOWLEDGE.md). The thing I am going to do here, explained in very very vast details there.

## 3.1. Start configuring `CMake` considering `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/` dir

### 3.1.1 Create `CMakeLists.txt` at `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/` dir.

```sh
touch tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/CMakeLists.txt
```

### 3.1.2. Now populate `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/CMakeLists.txt` with following cmake `commands()`

```cmake
set(LLVM_TARGET_DEFINITIONS Ops.td)
mlir_tablegen(Ops.h.inc -gen-op-decls)
mlir_tablegen(Ops.cpp.inc -gen-op-defs)
mlir_tablegen(Dialect.h.inc -gen-dialect-decls)
mlir_tablegen(Dialect.cpp.inc -gen-dialect-defs)

# Defining the target alias "ToyCh2OpsIncGen". This alias will be called as a dependency to tools/toy-compiler/lib/Dialect/Dialect.cpp

# Means, before the actual compilation starts, all the mlir_tablegen() commands will be executed by cmake; in order to produce those .h.inc, .inc type headers.

# They will be generated at build/tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/ dir. Donot be confused.

# That's why we have to point this include location at "tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt" as "include_directories("${STANDALONE_BINARY_DIR}/tools/toy-compiler/include")"
add_public_tablegen_target(ToyCh2OpsIncGen)
```

- When the CMake functions will be executed, those auto generated headers will be dumped at `build/tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/`

**Things to do later:**

- So that the main CMake config file (i.e. `tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt`) for our toy compiler knows this header include path for it's `-I` flag, we have to add `include_directories("build/tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/")` there later.

- In order to CMake execute `mlir_tablegen()` & `add_public_tablegen_target()` command, we have to also add this dir as `add_subdirectory("tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/")` at `tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt` later.

### 3.1.3 Create `CMakeLists.txt` at `tools/toy-compiler/include/` dir.

Because, step by step we have to create the cmake config connection to the outward dir nest, so that finally `tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt` detect it.

- Create `CMakeLists.txt`

```sh
touch tools/toy-compiler/include/CMakeLists.txt
```

- Now add inside `tools/toy-compiler/include/CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
add_subdirectory(Dialect)
```

Done for `tools/toy-compiler/include/` part ðŸ˜‡




## 3.2. Start configuring `CMake` considering `tools/toy-compiler/lib/Dialect/` dir

### 3.2.1 Create `CMakeLists.txt` at `tools/toy-compiler/lib/Dialect/` dir.

```sh
touch tools/toy-compiler/lib/Dialect/CMakeLists.txt
```

### 3.2.2. Now populate `tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect/CMakeLists.txt` with following cmake `command()`

```cmake
# "MLIRToyDialectCPP" is the alias through which tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt will target this lib
add_mlir_dialect_library(MLIRToyDialectCPP
    Dialect.cpp

    DEPENDS
    ToyCh2OpsIncGen # <= Telling cmake to generate .inc headers first. Add in Ch 2.0.
)
```

### 3.2.3. Now update the `tools/toy-compiler/lib/CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
add_subdirectory(toy-parser)

# Added in Ch 2.0.
add_subdirectory(Dialect)
```


### 3.2.4 Now update the `tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
# Set Toy Compiler binary filename
set(TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME "toy-compiler")


# "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}" always reads where the current `CMakeLists.txt` is located
# Right now ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} is called from this "/path/to/toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt" file
# So, ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} == ${TOY_MAIN_SRC_DIR} == /path/to/mlir-project/tools/toy-compiler


# Set all the required dirs
set(TOY_MAIN_SRC_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}")
set(TOY_INCLUDE_DIR "${TOY_MAIN_SRC_DIR}/include")
set(TOY_LIB_DIR "${TOY_MAIN_SRC_DIR}/lib")


# Point header files location (i.e. /path/to/mlir-project/tools/toy-compiler/include)
include_directories("${TOY_INCLUDE_DIR}")


# Added in Ch 2.0.
# ${STANDALONE_BINARY_DIR} == /path/to/mlir-project/build/
# For the auto gen ".inc" type headers, this is the location - build/tools/toy-compiler/include/Dialect
include_directories("${STANDALONE_BINARY_DIR}/tools/toy-compiler/include")


# Added in Ch 2.0.
# We have to also add the "${TOY_INCLUDE_DIR}" as "add_subdirectory()"
# So now cmake will also treat this dir as subdirectory to run the commands()
# Read section "2.1. `add_subdirectory()`" from "Docs/MISCELLANEOUS/CMAKE-HOW-TO/CMAKE-KNOWLEDGE.md" to understand the details
add_subdirectory("${TOY_INCLUDE_DIR}")



# Point lib files location (i.e. /path/to/mlir-project/tools/toy-compiler/lib)
# Why use "add_subdirectory", go to "Docs/MISCELLANEOUS/CMAKE-HOW-TO/CMAKE-KNOWLEDGE.md" and read "2.1. add_subdirectory()"
add_subdirectory("${TOY_LIB_DIR}")


# add new lib `MLIRToyParser` (i.e. alias to `AST.cpp`)
set(LIBS
        MLIRToyParser
        MLIRToyDialectCPP # <= Added in Ch 2.0
)


add_llvm_executable("${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}" toy-compiler.cpp)

# src- https://stackoverflow.com/a/71388662
# llvm_update_compile_flags adds -fno-exceptions to property COMPILE_FLAGS not COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
# Second, llvm_update_compile_flags inserts a space in front of the flag
llvm_update_compile_flags("${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}")

target_link_libraries("${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}" PRIVATE ${LIBS})

mlir_check_all_link_libraries("${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}")

install(TARGETS "${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}" DESTINATION bin)


```
