# Setup Toy Compiler Project Scaffold

## Where?

- Under `tools/` dir. Don't worry ðŸ˜…, it still doesn't exist. In this doc, we will talk, where & how to configure what...


## Code Editor

- I am using `VS Code` as my code editor. It's completely configurable according to your own dev + OS setup. Feel free to change them.
- All the `C++` or `Clang` based settings can be found at [c_cpp_properties.json](../../../.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json) file. This file tells the `VS Code`, where all the compiler binaries such as `g++`, `clang`, `clang++`, default `include` path, project `include` path, etc. lives in the OS.
- IDE based settings could be found in [settings.json](../../../.vscode/settings.json). You can configure, how much `tab space` you want, or which dirs are to exclude from `VS Code` search path, etc.
- You can automate different `build` or `run` command thorough [.vscode/tasks.json](../../../.vscode/tasks.json). This is not very handy for compiler kind of projects, but still you can use them.



## Required Folders/Dirs

- **We will not use `standalone-opt/`, `standalone-plugin/`, `standalone-translate/`, `python/`, `include/Standalone`, `include/Standalone-c`, `lib/CAPI`, `lib/Standalone`, `test/CAPI`, `test/python`, `test/Standalone` dirs. But We will keep them here, if we need to collect any reference/code/idea from them.**
- The Toy compiler project folder will be in `tools/` dir. By default `tools/` doesn't come with template. But the concept is, the main compiler entry point (i.e. `main.cpp`) file will be there, along with `include` and `lib` folders.
- We will be needing toy code files (e.g. `ast.toy`) to play/test with our toy compiler. We will be dumping all those examples inside `test/Examples/` dirs.
- We will need a `build/` dir, under which all the build assets will be dynamically generated. **There will be `build/bin/` dir, under which `toy-compiler` executable will be found after each successful build process.**


## 1. How to prepare this Toy project scaffold (just creating files & folders)

### 1.1. Collect all the `toy` code files from `llvm-18-src-build` and paste it under `test/`

- Create `Examples/` dir under `test`
```sh
mkdir -p test/Examples
```

- Copy all the toy files (i.e. `.toy`), and paste it here

```sh
cp -R /path/to/llvm-18-src-build/mlir/test/Examples/Toy/ test/Examples/
```


### 1.2. Create `tools/` dir and populate with necessary files + folders (i.e. `toy-compiler/`, etc.)

- Create `tools/` dir with `toy-compiler` dir inside. **The `toy-compiler` dir is our desired Toy Lang compiler dir ðŸ˜ƒ**
```sh
mkdir -p tools/toy-compiler
```

- Create all the dirs and files under `tools/` according to the following structure.

```sh
# Create all the subdirs first
mkdir -p tools/toy-compiler/include tools/toy-compiler/lib

# Create all the required files
touch tools/CMakeLists.txt tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt tools/toy-compiler/toy-compiler.cpp tools/toy-compiler/lib/CMakeLists.txt
```

```sh
# Finally the scaffold looks like..

â”œâ”€â”€ tools
    â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
    â””â”€â”€ toy-compiler
        â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
        â”œâ”€â”€ include
        â”œâ”€â”€ lib
        â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
        â””â”€â”€ toy-compiler.cpp  # <==== This is your toy-compiler entry point (i.e. where main() exists)
```



## 2. NOW LET'S START WRITING INITIAL CODE & CONFIGURE DIFFERENT `CMakeLists.txt` SO THAT WE CAN BUILD OUR FIRST `toy-compiler` BIN



### 2.1. Edit `toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/CMakeLists.txt` located at project-root dir (i.e. name of the project folder) to add `tools` dir to standalone template's `cmake` config


- We need to do this, so that the `cmake` knows, there's a new directory added to this standalone project. So add the following line at the end of the `toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/CMakeLists.txt`

```sh
# ==== Added later ====
add_subdirectory(tools)
```


### 2.2 Add `add_subdirectory(toy-compiler)` to `tools/CMakeLists.txt`

- Add to `tools/CMakeLists.txt` the following

```cmake
add_subdirectory(toy-compiler)
```

- This is the way, how `cmake` start to make connection from outer dir (i.e. `tools/`) to inner dir (i.e. `tools/toy-compiler`)


### 2.3. Now we need to populate the entry point `tools/toy-compiler/toy-compiler.cpp` entry point (i.e. where `main()` is defined)

- Let's populate `tools/toy-compiler/toy-compiler.cpp` file with empty `main()` function

```c++

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    
    // To-do

    // Parse the command line arguments & flags


    // Parse code file (i.e. code into LLVM module)
    

    // Do something with module (setup Lexer, Parser)


    // Then Dump the module
    

    return 0;
}

```


### 2.4. Write the MOST IMPORTANT `cmake config` for `toy-compiler` at `tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt`

- This cmake config defines all the necessary `cmake` rules for successful building of `toy-compiler`

- Let's put the following config in `tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake


# Set Toy Compiler binary filename
set(TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME "toy-compiler")


# "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}" always reads where the current `CMakeLists.txt` is located
# Right now ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} is called from this "/path/to/toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt" file
# So, ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} == ${TOY_MAIN_SRC_DIR} == /path/to/mlir-project/tools/toy-compiler


# Set all the required dirs
set(TOY_MAIN_SRC_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}")
set(TOY_INCLUDE_DIR "${TOY_MAIN_SRC_DIR}/include")
set(TOY_LIB_DIR "${TOY_MAIN_SRC_DIR}/lib")


# Point header files location (i.e. /path/to/mlir-project/tools/toy-compiler/include)
include_directories("${TOY_INCLUDE_DIR}")


# Point lib files location (i.e. /path/to/mlir-project/tools/toy-compiler/lib)
# Why use "add_subdirectory", go to "Docs/MISCELLANEOUS/CMAKE-HOW-TO/CMAKE-KNOWLEDGE.md" and read "1."
add_subdirectory("${TOY_LIB_DIR}")


# Right now there are no lib files inside lib/ dir. But in next chapter, we are going to add it
set(LIBS "")


add_llvm_executable("${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}" toy-compiler.cpp)

# src- https://stackoverflow.com/a/71388662
# llvm_update_compile_flags adds -fno-exceptions to property COMPILE_FLAGS not COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
# Second, llvm_update_compile_flags inserts a space in front of the flag
llvm_update_compile_flags("${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}")

target_link_libraries("${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}" PRIVATE ${LIBS})

mlir_check_all_link_libraries("${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}")

install(TARGETS "${TOY_COMPILER_BIN_NAME}" DESTINATION bin)

```


### 2.5. Let's edit the build shell file to tell we want to target `toy-compiler`

- Our target build is `toy-compiler`. Let's edit the `toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/build-mlir-18.sh` shell file for that.


```sh

export LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/llvm-18-src-build
export BUILD_DIR=$LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT/build
export PREFIX=$BUILD_DIR/lib/cmake/mlir


rm -R build/
mkdir -p build
cd build/

cmake   \
    -G Ninja    \
    -S ../  \
    -B .    \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG    \
    -DLLVM_DIR=$BUILD_DIR       \
    -DMLIR_DIR=$PREFIX      \
    -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=$BUILD_DIR/bin/llvm-lit     \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$BUILD_DIR/bin/clang    \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$BUILD_DIR/bin/clang++    \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON    \
    -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=1     



# cmake --build . --target standalone-opt
# cmake --build . --target standalone-translate
# cmake --build . --target mlir-doc
cmake --build . --target toy-compiler
```

**How does `cmake` know where is the `--build . --target toy-compiler`? Because `cmake` recursively searches for `toy-compiler` cmake config from outer dir to inner dir. How?**

**Process of searching the target:**

- 1. First it searches `toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/CMakeLists.txt`. It cannot find anything named with `toy-compiler` there. But it found the `add_subdirectory(tools)` or `tools` dir.
- 2. Then it start searching in `toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/tools/CMakeLists.txt`. Here it found `add_subdirectory(toy-compiler)` or `toy-compiler/` folder.
- 3. Then it get inside `toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/tools/toy-compiler/CMakeLists.txt` and found the target is explicitly written there.


### 2.6. (Just knowledge) Why `toy-compiler/lib/CMakeLists.txt` is kept empty? Or why there are more empty `CMakeLists.txt` in different places?

**Ans: Actually this concept expands to all the other empty `CMakeLists.txt`. `cmake` has to (know + track) the (current + future) (libs + headers).**





## 3. All configuration are done. Now it's time to run the compile

- Run `./build-mlir-18.sh`.

- It should return following logs. And it is working ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

```sh
-- The CXX compiler identification is Clang 18.0.0
-- The C compiler identification is Clang 18.0.0
....
.....
.....
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /path/to/toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/build
[2/2] Linking CXX executable bin/toy-compiler
```

- You can find the bin here `build/bin/toy-compiler`

- Now the `toy-compiler` bin is empty. So we can't use it. Little by little we start to add code in next chapters.

#  That's all. So our `cmake` config + project scaffold is working.... ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
