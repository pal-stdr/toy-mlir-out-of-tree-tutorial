# How to Setup MLIR standalone out-of-tree Project

## Prerequisites

- LLVM-18 (Or any other version) build
- Consider the `llvm-project` of version 18 src dir renamed to `llvm-18-src-build`
- **The LLVM version, and the MLIR standalone template version should be exactly same.**. To ensure this, we should copy the MLIR `standalone` template folder from `llvm-project` src tree (i.e. from `llvm-18-src-build` src files.), which we just built.


## 1. Why this is called out-of-tree project? Or why even we develop a MLIR project in a out-of-tree manner?
Because the `llvm-18-src-build` have enormous amount of dev files, projects..... a gigantic forest 😬. Main objective is to separate the MLIR dev from that forest.

By being an out-of-tree project, MLIR can be developed independently from the LLVM compiler, allowing for faster iteration and more controlled development of its features. As an out-of-tree project, MLIR can be more easily modified and experimented with without the need to build and integrate changes into the LLVM codebase. This independence also facilitates collaboration with other projects that share similar goals, such as Halide and TensorFlow Lite. For details, highly recommend to watch the [video presentation here](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/mlirdialect/).


## 2. Prepare MLIR Standalone

**This process is simple like piece-of-cake. Just copy-pasting 🙂🙂**

### 2.1. Find the `standalone` dir from `llvm-18-src-build`
- **Actually this `standalone` dir is your desired out-of-tree MLIR template.**
- `cd` to `llvm-18-src-build` like `cd /path/to/llvm-18-src-build`.
```sh
# You will find it here.
tree . -L 3 -d -P `mlir` --matchdirs
# Returns
.....
......
├── mlir
│   ├── benchmark
│   │   └── python
│   ├── cmake
│   │   └── modules
│   ├── docs
│   │   ├── Bindings
│   │   ├── DefiningDialects
..........
.............
│   ├── examples
│   │   ├── minimal-opt
│   │   ├── standalone	# <==== This is the one
│   │   ├── toy
│   │   └── transform
......
.......
```

### 2.2. Copy the `standalone` dir from `llvm-18-src-build` to your Desired Location

- `cd` to `llvm-18-src-build` like `cd /path/to/llvm-18-src-build`, if it is not as active dir in your terminal. And then
```sh
# Format
cp -R mlir/examples/standalone/ /path/to/your/desired/location/


# If you are using this git cloned tutorial template (i.e. "toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial"), use following copy method
# It will copy all the files & folders inside of "standalone" dir, and then dump them inside "/toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/"
cp -R mlir/examples/standalone/* /path/to/toy-mlir-out-of-tree-tutorial/


# I use this one. You can also 
cp -R mlir/examples/standalone/ /path/to/compiler-projects/mlir-18-standalone-dev
```

- **THIS IS DONE**. You have successfully extracted the MLIR `standalone` template out-of-tree of `llvm-project` src tree 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂.
- If you want to rename the folder according to your project name, feel free to do it.


## 3. Prepare `build-mlir-18.sh` with `cmake` configs to build `standalone` template

- Create the `build-mlir-18.sh` with `cmake` configs to build the `standalone` template.

```sh
# Path to your "llvm-18-src-build"
export LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/llvm-18-src-build
export BUILD_DIR=$LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT/build
# Or, you can use the installation/ dir. Both works 🙂. But the `llvm-lit` is missing in `installation/bin/`. So if you use `installation/`, then you might be getting this warning "LLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT set to /path/to/llvm-18-src-build/installation/bin/llvm-lit, but the path does not exist."
# export BUILD_DIR=$LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT/installation
export PREFIX=$BUILD_DIR/lib/cmake/mlir


# This is my own configuration 😉
# export LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT=$MY_EXTERNAL_SDD_WORK_DIR/compiler-projects/llvm-18-src-build
# export BUILD_DIR=$LLVM_PROJECT_ROOT/installation
# export PREFIX=$BUILD_DIR/lib/cmake/mlir


rm -R build/

mkdir -p build
cd build/

cmake   \
    -G Ninja    \
    -S ../  \
    -B .    \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG    \
    -DLLVM_DIR=$BUILD_DIR       \
    -DMLIR_DIR=$PREFIX      \
    -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=$BUILD_DIR/bin/llvm-lit     \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$BUILD_DIR/bin/clang    \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$BUILD_DIR/bin/clang++    \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON    \
    -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=1


cmake --build . --target standalone-opt
cmake --build . --target standalone-translate
cmake --build . --target mlir-doc


# Notes
# 1. -DLLVM_USE_LINKER=“lld”. In order to use lld linker, it has to be available in $PATH. Neither it would give error something like this "Host compiler does not support -fuse-ld=/path/to/compiler-projects/llvm-src-17-build/installation/bin/lld . You should have the "lld" linker when you have manually installed the "
```


## 3. Start building with `build-mlir-18.sh`

- Run the `build-mlir-18.sh` from `standalone` dir
```sh
./build-mlir-18.sh
```

- When you run the `build-mlir-18.sh`, you should see a lot of `cmake` configuration log reports are coming in the terminal. I am avoiding those, and giving the needed information to check, if your build is working properly...

```sh
-- The CXX compiler identification is Clang 18.0.0
-- The C compiler identification is Clang 18.0.0
.......
........
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /path/to/standalone/build
[14/14] Linking CXX executable bin/standalone-opt
[9/9] Linking CXX executable bin/standalone-translate
[4/4] Generating ../../docs/Standalone/StandaloneOps.md
```

- So the build log says, `build/bin/` contains the built binary `standalone-opt` & `standalone-translate`. You can start playing with them 😁. However, this tutorial's scope is `Toy` compiler. So I will not be going through those bins.

- Also the MLIR docs are automatically generated, could be found at `build/docs`

- Every time you run the `build-mlir-18.sh` shell, the `build` dir will be removed, and recreated with fresh built assets.

# Means, the MLIR out-of-tree `standalone` template is WORKING perfectly. 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
